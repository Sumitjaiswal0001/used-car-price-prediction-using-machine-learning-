Introduction
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict the price of a used car based on various features such as make, model, year, mileage, and more. The project includes a web application to interact with the model, allowing users to input car details and get price predictions.

Features
Data preprocessing and feature engineering
Model training and evaluation
Web application for price prediction
Interactive user interface with HTML and CSS
RESTful API built with Flask
